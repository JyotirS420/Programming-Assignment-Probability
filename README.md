# Programming Assignment (Probability)

Programming Assignment for Probability and Statistics [(MTH201)](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=MTH201)  

**Aim:** Observe the time gaps between 30 WhatsApp messages and plot a relative frequency line graph of the data. Plot a graph of the exponential and normal pdfs using the sample mean and variance as parameters and decide which one matches better.

**Observations:** The exponential curve matches better to my data. This makes sense as exponential pdfs are frequently found in daily life where we need to measure the time expected for an event to occur, for example time between calls, time between earthquakes, etc.  A very analogous example which is also modeled by exponential random variable is the number of cars passing a certain place per minute, in our case cars can treated similar to messages.  
The message intervals were observed and hardcoded into the `.py` file. The time intervals have been recorded in `minutes`.

The plots generated were as follows:
